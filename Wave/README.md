# Mobile Challenge

### How to set up application
1. Clone this repo.
2. In Android Studio:
  1. Quick Start "Import project".
  2. Navigate to import mobile-challenge/Wave.
  
### How to run application
1. [Set up your own Android Device configuration](http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-studio.html) or click the green "Play" button to run the app, choosing an appropriate already running device or launching an appropriate emulator.
2. The application should be running on the device.

### Implementation highlights
I'm particularly happy that I used Spring's RestTemplate to implement the REST client because I've never used Spring before, and when I did so, it jived with the Android app very simply and cleanly.
